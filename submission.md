## Submission Questions

### What is the goal/problem the project addresses?

The problem the project addresses is the overall poor math performance in the US with an emphasis on preparing underrepresented demographics for formal math through informal at home, parent guided math and metacognition education.

I go into more detail about the background and problem revolving around this idea in the projects [README](./README.md)

### What technology/hardware was used for the project
- Ruby on Rails for backend
- ReactJS for frontend
- Heroku (AWS EC2) for hosting
- Vis.js for the data viz

### How does your project work (demonstration)
In the most brief of terms, the project doesn't work. But a working prototype does exist and gives a very low-fidelity representation of what the final tool could be.

An interactive graph that represents a learner's personalized journey through math fundamentals that provides caregivers with the right information and easy at home activities and games to teach their kids math.

### What are some future improvements or features?
- Add digital games to teach each subject
- Add virtual agent to assist parents and children while playing
- Add edge weight prediction algorithm to make learning paths more adaptive and personalized
- Add shortest path visualization for parents
- Add more conventional visualizations that are less coupled to being comfortable with math/graphs that abstract complexities away
- Improve UX

### The project is more important than pretty slides.

### write up of your project so you can tell us what you did!
I created a proof of concept web application that lays the groundwork for a tool that can enrich relationships between caregivers and their children, can teach both parents and kids metacognitive skills, can prepare kids for formal math education and future careers in STEM, can disuade gender biases, increase diversity, and teach the growth mindset.
